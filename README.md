# Capstone3_Customer_segmentation
This is my independent project. The project was part of Springboard training program. Its goal is to perform effective customer segmentation. 

Companies want to adjust their marketing campaigns, product promotions, and other individualized selling strategies. 
Identifying customer clusters/groups helps them to create targeted marketing and personalized services for the customers. 
For example, identifying the top spending customers can be critical. Companies' top-level customers can receive more attention while building customer relationships
and drawing retaining plans. 
Unsupervised learning was used to cluster the data. The data were clustered on some of the main features related to total spending and responsiveness to marketing 
promotions. I evaluated only models that can cluster the dataset but can also be used to make predictions on new data.
I intentionally didnâ€™t use some of the most widely used algorithms, because they are not intended to be used on new, unseen data. 
After the segmentation, each cluster was described by the rest of the features.
